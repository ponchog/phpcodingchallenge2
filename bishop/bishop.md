The challenge
-
This is the story of a shortsighted Bishop, this poor bishop just couldn’t see beyond his nose! The problem is that he doesn’t know how many squares he is attacking from his current position. And for a bishop, well, that’s pretty bad. So he needs you to help him find out how many squares he is attacking from his current position.
