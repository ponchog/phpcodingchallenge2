=

The Challenge
-
Due to the high number of Spurs and FIFA World Cup fans being caught lately by the police while drunk driving, you have been assigned the task to develop a little program that can tell people how drunk they really are before driving
Specifications
-
The program will take in multiple inputs then output the Users BAC (blood alcohol concentration percentage) and a Message related to their BAC: 


You will need this
-

Liquid Ounces of Alcohol per beer bottle = 0.60

Liquid Ounces of Alcohol per glass of wine = 0.65

Liquid Ounces of Alcohol per tequila shot = 70

This is how you calculate your %BAC

%BAC = (A x 5.14/W x r) â€“ .015 x H

A = Total liquid ounces

W = Weight

r = is the alcohol distribution ratio which for men is 0.73 and for women is 0.66


Input
-
Inputs: User Weight, User Sex, Hours Spent Drinking, # of Beers, # of Wine Glasses, # of Tequila Shots
